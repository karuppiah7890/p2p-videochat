# [P2P Video Chat](https://p2p-videochat-uxtwsdpire.now.sh/)

It's a Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Video Chat Web application. People can go to the [site](https://p2p-videochat-uxtwsdpire.now.sh/) and give access Audio/Video access to the web page and then type a room name and ask their partner to do the same, then finally chat with them!

The only catch is, you gotta type a unique room name and then share the name with your friend.

I have to work and change the UI/UX to tackle the problem of room name conflicts, by generating room names automatically. Something like the one in https://rollcall.audio or like https://appear.in.
